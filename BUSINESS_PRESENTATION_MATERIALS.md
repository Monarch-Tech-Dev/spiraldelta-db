## Demo Scripts by Audience

### Technical Demo (15 minutes)
```python
# Live coding demonstration
from spiraldelta import SpiralDeltaDB
import numpy as np

# Show compression in action
db = SpiralDeltaDB(dimensions=768, compression_ratio=0.7)
vectors = np.random.randn(10000, 768)  # Simulate BERT embeddings

# Demonstrate performance
start_time = time.time()
db.insert(vectors, metadata=[{"id": i} for i in range(10000)])
insert_time = time.time() - start_time

# Show search speed
start_time = time.time()
results = db.search(vectors[0], k=10)
search_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Inserted 10K vectors in {insert_time:.3f}s")

## ROI Calculation Framework

### For Enterprise Customers

**Storage Cost Savings:**
```
Traditional vector DB cost: $X per GB/month
SpiralDeltaDB cost: $X * 0.3 per GB/month (70% reduction)
Monthly savings: (Data volume in GB) * $X * 0.7
Annual savings: Monthly savings * 12
```

**Performance Benefits:**
```
Faster queries → Improved user experience → Higher conversion
10x query speed → 15% better user engagement → $Y revenue impact
Reduced infrastructure → Lower operational costs → $Z cost reduction
```

**Total ROI Calculation:**
```
Year 1 Savings: Storage savings + Performance benefits + Operational efficiency
Implementation cost: License fees + Migration + Training
ROI = (Savings - Implementation cost) / Implementation cost * 100%

Typical ROI: 200-400% in first year for medium-large deployments
```

### For Startups/SMBs

**Development Velocity:**
- "Comprehensive Python API reduces integration time by 60%"
- "Built-in monitoring eliminates need for separate observability stack"
- "Open source version accelerates MVP development"

**Scaling Economics:**
- "Self-hosted deployment eliminates per-vector pricing"
- "Compression reduces hosting costs as data grows"
- "Performance headroom delays infrastructure scaling needs"

## Objection Handling

### "Why not use established solutions like Pinecone?"
